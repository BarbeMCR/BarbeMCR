## Hello, world! I'm BarbeMCR!

### I am learning
- Python (since June 2021): my main language
- Ruby (since March 2023)
- mlmcr (since the beginning of time): my own (kinda) esoteric programming language

I have also previously done some surface-level coding in:
- C++
- HTML + CSS
- JavaScript

And I have also used Batch, JSON and INI here and there (if that counts).

### Currently, I am working on
- [BarbeMCR's The Betrothed](https://github.com/BarbeMCR/the-betrothed), a Python platformer thing implemented with Pygame
- [BarbeMCR's The Betrothed Launcher](https://github.com/BarbeMCR/the-betrothed-launcher), a launcher for BarbeMCR's The Betrothed made in Python
- [mlmcr](https://github.com/BarbeMCR/mlmcr), an esoteric Assembly-like programming language made in pure Python
- [BarbeMCR's OpenCipher](https://github.com/BarbeMCR/opencipher), an encryption/decryption CL-based application and (*Python*) API for obfuscating files and texts (*__not__* safe for actual cryptography)

### Completed projects
- [Pytracer](https://github.com/BarbeMCR/pytracer), a Python re-implementation of the C++ raytracer in the "Raytracing in One Weekend" book
- [tb012to013](https://github.com/BarbeMCR/tb012to013), a utility for converting BarbeMCR's The Betrothed 0.12 savefiles to version 0.13 (and newer, thanks to the in-game savefile upgrade feature)

**I use Visual Studio Code as my main text editor and IDE. In the past, I used Atom for that purpose. I sometimes still use Notepad++ (like in my early Batch scripting days) for quick projects.**
